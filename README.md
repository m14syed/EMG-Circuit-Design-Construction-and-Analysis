EMG Circuit for Biomedical Instrumentation | C++, Arduino, LabView, Git | Winter 2024
Developed an EMG (Electromyography) circuit from scratch to capture and analyze muscle activity signals.
Designed and constructed the hardware circuit using operational amplifiers and an instrumentation amplifier to achieve a gain of approximately 1000.
Implemented a band-pass filter to isolate bicep EMG signals between 20 Hz to 1000 Hz, ensuring accurate signal processing.
Integrated the circuit with an Arduino microcontroller to digitize analog signals and trigger LED feedback for muscle contractions.
Utilized LabView for real-time data visualization and analysis of EMG signals.
Conducted rigorous testing and calibration, achieving an actual gain of 919 and effectively filtering out noise for clear signal interpretation.
